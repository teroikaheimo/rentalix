# rentalix
Second year school project. Objective is to make a fullstack application for fictional equipment rental company. I chose NodeJS, ExpressJS and MySQL DB as my backend and React handles the frontend. Bootstrap deals with the responsive layout. This is my first time using NodeJS and React in an application so it won't be pretty and concice but a great learning experience!

## Installation
1. Clone the git repo.
2. Navigate to react-backend folder in console. Run -> ```npm install```
3. Use scripts from Database folder to create MySQL schema and import the dummy data if needed.
4. Create needed accounts and assign needed permission.
5. In react-backend folder use the connection.template.js to create connection.js file with login data for the DB.
6. Now that the MySQL DB is running. Start the expressJS server by -> ```npm start```
7. Go to your browser and navigate to localhost:3210
#### Done.
